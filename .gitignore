# The list of files that should be ignored by Mr Bones.
# Lines that start with '#' are comments.
#
# A .gitignore file can be used instead by setting it as the ignore
# file in your Rakefile:
#
#   Bones {
#     ignore_file  '.gitignore'
#   }
#
# For a project with a C extension, the following would be a good set of
# exclude patterns (uncomment them if you want to use them):
# *.[oa]
